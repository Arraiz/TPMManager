Basic Installation
==================

This package is built using Qt's qmake. qmake automatically generates a makefile from the Qt project file.
   
1. Requirements
===============
Since the TPM Manager is based entirely on the Qt UI framework, corresponding header and library ﬁles Qt4 should be in the library path. On some linux distributions you have to install the developer version of Qt to have the header ﬁles used by TPM Manager.

Requirements to build the TPM Manager: 
• Qt4 (>= 4.4)
• TrouSerS 
The required packages for (k)Ubuntu in detail are: 
• build-essential 
• libtspi-dev 
• libtspi1 
• trousers 
• libqt4-dev

To use the features of the TPM Manager you need a running TrouSerS daemon. The TPM Manager has been successfully compiled under Qt version 4.4.3 and KDE 4.1 respectively GNOME 2.26. 

2. Installation and Configuration
================================
The TPM Manager is hosted on sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tpmmanager/. The software is based on qmake; therefore, it can be conﬁgured and installed as described below. 

Note that on some systems, qmake points to an older version of Qt - Qt3. Check 
your version of Qt prior to compiling TPM Manager as described below.

# qmake -v
# QMake version 2.01a
# Using Qt version 4.5.2 in /usr/lib

If qmake points to a 3.X version of Qt, use qmake-qt4 instead of qmake.

# tar −xzf tpmmanager−0.8.1.tar.gz 
# cd tpmmanager−0.8.1
# qmake
# make 
# install bin/tpmmanager /path/to/install/directory // e.g., "install bin/tpmmanager /usr/local/bin"

3. Usage
========
Make will create the TPM Manager binary in the bin/ subdirectory. You can run make install to install TPM Manager in default binary path of your system. To start TPM Manager, type tpmmanager on terminal or simply double-click the application icon in your file manager.
You may also add TPM Manager to your Application starter menu, e.g., in Gnome or KDE.
